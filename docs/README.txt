The programming documentation for the DCM is provided as both a pdf and html.

It is recommended the reader uses the html version unless there is an explicit
reason they cannot view html documents.

Most of these documents are automatically generated using industry used tools
such as Sphinx and PyTest, who chose to output their documents in html format
for better readability.

To read the programming documentation for the DCM, open the 'index.html' file.

The documentation is formated into an easily readable and navigatable html
directory for the readers convenience.
